# Special Offer

Hello,

I’m a freelance software engineer specializing in web and mobile development. Have you heard of **Upwork**? It’s the largest freelancing platform, where many clients and freelancers work together.

Upwork also has a dedicated space that helps U.S. clients find local freelancers, and the project scopes and budgets are often very attractive. Although I’m not a local developer, I can still deliver exactly what they’re looking for.

How about working together? If you allow me to use your **Upwork** account remotely, I’ll secure projects, deliver the services, and share 20% of the income with you.

Let me know if you're interested.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
